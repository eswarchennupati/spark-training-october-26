# Installing Apache Spark on Windows 10

1. We recommend to use **Windows Subsystem for Linux** for running Spark locally. Although it is possible to run Spark on Windows without WSL, we still recommend to have a "native" Linux environment on your machine. Here is an excellent step-by-step tutorial on how to install WSL: [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)

2. Once you have your WSL environment up and running, please follow the installation steps for [Ubuntu Linux 20.04](https://github.com/garzoand/spark-training-october-13/blob/master/preparation/install_spark_ubuntu20.md)
